## Development

### Docker Engine

Install the Docker Engine by following the procedure described here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/.

Based on the use-case, check out the documenation here on how to configure your installation to allow a non-root user to use docker: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/.

During the development of this project a Debian distro running on Raspberry PI 5 was used.

Rather than using Docker Desktop for Mac, a good alternative would be to use OrbStack: https://orbstack.dev.

Test the installation by attempting to download and run the Python Poetry docker image.

```bash
docker run -it weastur/poetry:1.8.3-python-3.9.19-bookworm /bin/bash
```

The cotainer used above has support for multiple architectures: https://hub.docker.com/r/weastur/poetry/tags.

### Visual Studio Code
